	<h3>Biography</h3>
		<p>I attend the Academy for Careers in Television and Film. As of right now I don't have an internship and I don't have a job. I am intrested in film, music and in making a lot of money. When I get to college I would like to study music, media and economics.</p>
		<p>One of my favorite things to do is play music. I enjoy playing my alto saxophone and teaching young kids how to read music. Nobody in my family is a musician besides me so I push myself to work hard and become a great player. When I am bored I watch televison or walk outside. I also visit my grandma because she always gives me food to eat. She usually jsut feeds me and watches the news.</p>
